# Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website built with pure HTML and CSS to showcase my web development skills and projects.

This is my first portfolio website, created after learning HTML and CSS. I built this project from scratch to implement and demonstrate my understanding of:

- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Responsive design principles
- CSS gradients and transitions
- Form styling and validation

  - About - Skills, education, and interests
  - Services - Professional services offered
  - Contact - Contact form and information
- **Modern UI**: Gradient color scheme with smooth animations
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, buttons, and navigation
- **Sticky Navigation**: Easy navigation that stays visible while scrolling

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **CSS3**: Styling, layouts, animations, and responsiveness

- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting (if deployed)

## 🎨 Color Palette
